# Facial Landmarks with dlib,OpenCV,and Python

## Facial landmarks are used to localize regions of face like 

* Eyes 
* Mouth
* Nose
* Jawline
* Eyebrows

## Two steps of detecting Facial Landmarks

* Finding the face area
* marking key facial features 


### We can achieve face detection by a number of ways

* OpenCV Haar cascades
* deep learning based algorithms
* Linear SVM object detector
 ##### it  actually dosen't matter which method we use

## Step 2 

### Facial landmarks detector in dlib is an implementation of  One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees paper 


### The pre trained detector in dlib estimates the location of 68-(x,y)-coordinates 

### There also exists a 194 point model trained on HELEN dataset
